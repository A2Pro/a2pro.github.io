        I'm Aayush Palai, a developer based in San Jose.
        <br>
        I want to make software that encapsulates people's visions, as well as my own. I mainly use Flask for web development, but sometimes use Django.
        <br>
        For front-end, I use vanilla, and sometimes react. 
        <br>
        Since I know Python extremely well, other languages often come naturally to me, simply a difference of syntax.
        <br>
        I don't do this only for the money. You can see off my profile I often take low-paying but interesting bounties.
